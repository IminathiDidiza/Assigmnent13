# Branch Protection Rules

## Overview
This document explains the branch protection rules implemented for the main branch of our Student Attendance System repository.

## Protection Rules

### 1. Require Pull Request Reviews
- **Rule**: At least one approval required before merging
- **Why**: Ensures code quality through peer review
- **Benefits**:
  - Catches bugs and issues early
  - Maintains code quality standards
  - Shares knowledge across the team
  - Prevents accidental merges

### 2. Require Status Checks to Pass
- **Rule**: All CI checks must pass before merging
- **Why**: Ensures code stability and reliability
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents broken code from reaching main
  - Maintains build stability
  - Ensures all tests pass
  - Validates code quality metrics

### 3. Disable Direct Pushes
- **Rule**: No direct pushes to main allowed
- **Why**: Enforces proper code review process
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents accidental commits
  - Maintains audit trail
  - Ensures all changes are reviewed
  - Follows GitFlow best practices

## Implementation Steps

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Branches → Branch protection rules
3. Add rule for main branch
4. Configure the following settings:
   - ✓ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✓ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✓ Include administrators
   - ✓ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

## Impact on Development Workflow

1. Developers must:
   - Create feature branches
   - Submit pull requests
   - Address review comments
   - Ensure CI checks pass

2. Reviewers must:
   - Review code changes
   - Approve or request changes
   - Ensure code quality

3. Administrators must:
   - Follow the same process
   - Cannot bypass protection rules

## Best Practices

1. Keep branches up to date with main
2. Write clear commit messages
3. Respond promptly to review comments
4. Run tests locally before pushing
5. Keep pull requests focused and manageable
